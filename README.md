 ### Note for Firebase:
 - you need to create an account and a project with Firestore database
 - put your Firebase project settings into: src/environments/firebase.config.ts
 - you need to add some data to the Firestore database:
  - add "Events" collection
  - add some items there, something like this:
  
    {
    
        name: 'Google I/O 19 Ext Radzymin',
